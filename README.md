# LADXRandomizer
A randomizer for Link's Awakening DX (LADX) on the Game Boy Color.  
Unlike other randomizers at the time, this one focused on randomizing entrances (referred to as 'warps' throughout the project) rather than items.  

This was a passion and learning project that, unfortunately, remains unfinished.
While it does work to produce playable seeds, I believe there are gaps in the logic that may occasionally produce *unbeatable* seeds.

### RIP: 2016-12-13 - 2018-04-12
Started in Dec 2016, this project was inspired by the early popularity of the [ALttP randomizer](https://github.com/Dessyreqt/alttprandomizer).  
These days, there are much more sophisticated randomizers out there for LADX, such as:
- [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg)
- [LADXR](https://daid.github.io/LADXR)

## Requirements
- .NET Framework 4.8 
- Dumped ROM(s) of Link's Awakening DX J1.0, U1.0 and/or U1.2
