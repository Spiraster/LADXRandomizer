Seed Issues:
[ ] 51FBA927 - infinite loop

To Do:
[ ] Replace 'requiredWarps' with a list of tuples containing every possible constraint and the warps(/zone) associated with it
[ ] Make it possible to get Trendy Game powder if you have the mushroom
[ ] Code cleanup:
	[x] Replace 'map' with 'screen'
	[x] Change MapIndex to Index in Warp
	[x] Rename: Warp -> WarpData, and WarpData -> WarpList
	[x] Remove old commented code
	[ ] Remove unnecessary "this." calls
	[ ] Use WarpData.World where possible instead of Code.Contains
	[ ] Generate WarpData.Code in contructor rather than passing it (if Code is even needed at all)
	[ ] Update indexer for WarpList and ItemList to take string identifier and parse into World and Index
	[ ] Replace private fields in ScreenData with get-only properties
	[ ] Make sure code is properly organized in classes and files
[ ] Create separate logics (excel connections & pathfinder)
	[ ] Speedrunner
	[ ] Casual
[ ] Change the "RandomizeWarps" setting; it needs to be higher-level
	- establish design for this setting for future randomization options (e.g. random music, palettes, items, etc.)
[ ] Randomize and/or create random solutions for the egg maze
[ ] Turn the warp writing code in WriteRom into a local method (for the sake of MapIndex vs MapIndex2)
	- probably do this for the rest of WriteRom
[ ] Add/remove bomb triggers
[ ] Make it possible to jump off waterfalls without the flippers
[ ] Possibly add staircase to rapids ride warp
[ ] Solve issue with non-sidescroll warps in dungeons being saved (e.g. D3)
[ ] Update pathfinding
	[x] Add l2 shield
	[ ] Add golden leaves
	[ ] Add mermaid scale
	[ ] Add boomerang
	[ ] Add ghost
	[ ] Add trade items
	[ ] Rooster can replace need for OW feather (w/ bracelet)
	[ ] Bananas can give access to Zone 9 w/o flippers
[ ] Update settings code and UI
[ ] Redo log writing and saving
	- add error log?

Future Plans:
[ ] Rename warp codes properly for OW and UWs (and adjust OW2 descriptions)
[ ] Renumber the OW zones
[ ] Properly add ignored warps to randomizer and exclude them until sorted out

[x] Press 'Enter' to create seed if textbox has focus
[ ] Figure out namespaces
[ ] Rework settings customization
[x] Rename all uses of "address" in code to "offset"

[ ] (Re-)implement softlock-free logic
	[ ] Make sword pickup mandatory before exploring
	[ ] Add map edits for Zone 10
	[ ] Force deadends behind bombable caves instead of opening them
	[ ] Fix remaining one-ways:
		[ ] make flame skip cave require L2 shield both ways, or have flame skip only take 1 hit
		[ ] D8 entrance on OW (one-way w/o bombs)
		[ ] Richard's villa and cave
		[ ] stone-covered entrances (force deadends)
		[ ] prevent flock clipping dream shrine and woods cave??
		[ ] Mamu's cave (force deadend)

- Ideas for game modes:
	[ ] Make each intrument reveal one of the 8 egg directions (either replace instrument sprites or find way to tie it to the book)
	[ ] Make each telephone booth reveal one of the egg directions (intruments may not be required to beat the game)
	[ ] Make only a select few (i.e. 1 or 2) instruments required to open the egg, and place WHICH instruments in the book
[ ] Add option to disable dialog
[ ] Add seed hash to title screen (as with ALttP)
[ ] Try to fix waterfall warps immediately after unlock
[ ] Remove side of MeowMeow's house on doghouse screen
[x] Add a mechanic to return to base spawn (for use in case of softlock)
[ ] Get it working with U1.0
[ ] Add 'Hard' preset (checked for solvability like 'Standard' but warps are unpaired)
[ ] Add 'Dungeon Guantlet' preset once details are worked out
[ ] Add option to shuffle dungeon/cave stairs
[ ] Add option to shuffle portals
[ ] Write enabled options to ROM (0xFF000)
[ ] Create output hash based on the randomized elements (can be used to tell duplicate randomizations from different seeds)
	- Use hashids to generate unique identifier (for use on title screen)
[ ] Update hashing methods to be more secure (for potential race ROMs):
	- Use Murmur (or ticks) as initial seed
	- Generate hash using SHA-256
	- Seed MT with the SHA hash
	- Use hashids to shorten SHA hash (as output string)
[ ] Update the ROM's global checksum (eventhough it doesn't matter)
	
[ ] Add chest randomization
	- Begin with only shuffling items within dungeons
	
Ignored warps:
- Village well
- Fisherman's bridge (need to figure out effect of difference in format)
- Martha's Bay SS
- Manbo's cave
- Flooded cave
- (Pit to flooded cave)

Known Issues:
- "Glitchless" logic still account for bombs at walrus
- "Glitchless" logic likely has gaps in D8
- D7 entrance and mermaid cave connections aren't properly accounted for (due to outward softlocks)
- Shuffling the mermaid cave can result in a glitched ML
- Singpost maze stops working after obtaining song #3
- Pathfinder only recognizes D6 and D8 from the front entrances (is this a problem?)
- It may be possible to have mushroom and require the powder without access to the witch
- It's possible to exit into the undrained waterfall without the flippers (you can't house warp from this)
- It may be required to enter D0 entrance, but be unable to get rid of bow wow (or another follower)
- D7 instrument clears the rooster, which may be required (glitchless)
- Bowwow prevents trading for the monkey bridge (not currently in logic)
- Rapids ride is currently unaccounted for
		
Notes:
- "Glitchless" logic still assumes knowledge of:
	- walrus skip
	- bombable walls in D8 (and bomb-arrows)
