To Do:
[ ] Fixes:
	[ ] figure out why entrances got swapped at 0x1F in seed "B513A8BB"
	[ ] figure out how the pathfinder was able to solve seed "B513A8BB"
	[ ] add map edits for Zone 10
	[ ] move sword from beach to house
	[ ] make flame skip cave require L2 shield both ways, or have flame skip only take 1 hit
	[ ] force deadends behind bombable caves instead of opening them
	[ ] prevent "house by the bay" from pairing with either D5 entrance or armos shrine
	[ ] fix remaining one-ways:
		[ ] D8 entrance
		[ ] Richard's villa and cave
		[ ] stone-covered entrances (force deadends)
		[ ] prevent flock clipping dream shrine and woods cave??
		[ ] Mamu's cave (force deadend)
			- also find solution for cave being inaccessible after obtaining Song 3
[ ] Solve issue where < 218 warps are accessible after randomization
[ ] Update pathfinding
	[ ] Possibly implement functional backtracking for the pathfinder (vs snapping back)
	[x] Include all item constraints where necessary
	[ ] Account for powder as a damage item?
	[ ] Add all items (even if non-essential)
		- potentially add trade items and l2 sword?

Future Plans:
[ ] Rename warp codes properly for OW and UWs (in excel)
[ ] Renumber the OW zones
[ ] Properly add ignored warps to randomizer and exclude them until sorted out

[ ] Press 'Enter' to create seed if textbox has focus
[ ] Figure out namespaces
[ ] Rework settings customization
[ ] Rename all uses of "address" in code to "offset"
[ ] Make all "static readonly" Lists into ReadOnlyCollections

[ ] Add option to disable dialog
[ ] Remove owls
[ ] Add seed hash to title screen (as with ALttP)
[ ] Make sword pickup mandatory before exploring
[ ] Update unlock animation for 0x2B, and fix warps immediately after unlock
[ ] Remove side of MeowMeow's house on doghouse screen
[x] Add a mechanic to return to base spawn (for use in case of softlock)
[ ] Get it working with U1.0
[ ] Add 'Hard' preset (checked for solvability like 'Standard' but warps are unpaired)
[ ] Add 'Dungeon Guantlet' preset once details are worked out
[ ] Add option to shuffle dungeon/cave stairs
[ ] Add option to shuffle portals
[ ] Write enabled options to ROM (0xFF000)
[ ] Create output hash based on the randomized elements (can be used to tell duplicate randomizations from different seeds; SHA2?)
[ ] Make logic adjustments
	[ ] Add considerations for the ghost (don't spawn "house by the bay" behind D5 or southern face shrine)
- Fun randomizations:
	[ ] random chance for overworld changes (like no water)
	[ ] randomize obstacles for blocked staircases (i.e. rocks, rooster statue, and mermaid statue)
	[ ] lanmolas pit
	
[ ] Add chest randomization
	
Ignored warps:
- Village well
- Fisherman's bridge (need to figure out effect of difference in format)
- Martha's Bay SS
- Manbo's cave
- Flooded cave
- (Pit to flooded cave)

Known Limitations:

Potential Issues:
- There's nothing stopping softlocks without the sword
- D8 entrance could be a one-way softlock without the bombs
- Richard's Villa is a 1-way without the slime key (or leaves)
- Stones and rooster statue could be one-ways
- Mamu's cave can't be opened after getting song 3
		
Notes:
	- "Dead-ends" are only physical dead-ends
	- Connections listed for all warps within a physical boundary
		- Item constraints are set per connection (not per area)
		- The direction for constraints are: FROM the connection TO the warp
	- ZoneConnections (in warps) are listed FROM the zone TO the warp (same convention as normal connections)
	- Zone objects will keep track exits that can access them (i.e. TO the zone FROM the warp)
	- One-way tunnels (i.e. D4 cave and raft cave) are treated as dead-ends for both warps
