Options:
	- .NET Core
		- Blazor for web
		- Easy native console apps
			- what about a GUI?
				- Qt (qmlnet)
				- Electron.NET? (or others?)
				- Avalonia
	- Electron
		- Port to JS/TS
		- Easy web deployment + native apps
	- NW.js
		- Similar to Electron
		- Easier communication between windows
		- Electron is more popular, but NW.js seems to have it's proponents too
	- Haxe
		- Transpile C# to Haxe
		- Compile to Node + desktop

2019-01-07:
- Ditch the UI
	- Make it a simple console app
	- Just focus on core functionality
- Switch to .NET Core (or something else?)
	- Something cross-platform and possible to integrate into a web app

This should probably be split into multiple projects:
	- Core randomization library
	- Desktop frontend
	- ASP.NET web frontend
	- ROM editing library
		- Can be dropped into future ROM editor project
			- Save edits as project file, rather than requiring a working ROM
	- Maybe utility library if required separately by the above projects

--------------------------------

Things that may be required by the logic:
- SJs (incl. naked)

Seed Issues:
[ ] 51FBA927 - infinite loop (D1 locked behind D7 entrance)

------------
-- To-do: --
------------
[ ] Code cleanup:
	[ ] Use WarpData.World where possible instead of Code.Contains
	[ ] Generate WarpData.Code in contructor rather than passing it (if Code is even needed at all)
	[ ] Update indexer for WarpList and ItemList to take string identifier and parse into World and Index
	- Simplify ScreenData class:
		[x] Move GetCollisionOffset and GetSpriteOffset methods into ROMBuffer
		[x] Move the various offset calculations into aforementioned methods
		[x] Create method to find end of collision/sprite data for a given bank instead of hard coding offsets for "buffers"
	[ ] Why do NextCollisionOffset/NextSpriteOffset and GetWarpOffset loop differently?
	[ ] Tidy Settings and ROMBuffer.ApplySettings()
	[ ] Do something about ApplyScreenEdits
	[ ] Put try-catch around File.WriteAllBytes()
	[ ] Better organize classes with respect to code files (one class per file?)
	[ ] Should ROMBuffer only contain simple manipulation methods?
		- handle more specific and complex methods elsewhere? (i.e. ApplySettings or WriteScreenEdits)
	[ ] Implement debug argument

[ ] Implement item locations into pathfinding
	- have pathfinder track these constraints as well
	- use these instead of 'requiredWarps' list

[ ] Implement theme shuffling for dungeons
	[ ] Separate the patches and screen edits from the main shuffling function
	[ ] Account for palette overrides AND use them to keep crystal/obstacle colours consistent
		- make pots default (if possible)
	[ ] Adjust object palettes based on new tile palettes (e.g. for flying tiles)
	[ ] Convert light-accented themes to be dark-accented to allow for full shuffling
	[ ] Fix gross looking floor2's (i.e. D5, D7 and D8 palettes)
	[ ] Fix palette for D7 boss
		- tileset needs to be updated for the relevant tiles but could potentially not work with other dungeons
	[ ] Expand shuffling beyond dungeons

[ ] Create separate logics (excel connections & pathfinder)
	[ ] Speedrunner
	[ ] Casual
[ ] Get unpaired warps working
[ ] Don't render followers in D0
[x] Make D4 warps active immediately after opening cutscene
[ ] Randomize dungeon palettes
[ ] Randomly replace tiles and palettes with sets from the oracles
[ ] Randomize soundtracks
[ ] Randomize and/or create random solutions for the egg maze
[ ] Add/remove bomb triggers
[ ] Possibly add staircase to rapids ride warp
[ ] Increase wallet to 4-digits
[ ] Update pathfinding
	[ ] Add golden leaves
	[ ] Add mermaid scale
	[ ] Add boomerang
	[ ] Add trade items
	[ ] Rooster can replace need for OW feather (w/ bracelet)
	[ ] Bananas can give access to Zone 9 w/o flippers
[x] Add support for custom chest event locations
	[x] Convert all key drops into chests
	[ ] Add screen edits for a couple of chest screens in D3
	[ ] Add screen edits for new chests in D0
[ ] Patch heart graphics to look like Oracles hearts
[ ] Find patch to make bombs/arrows/powder limitless
[ ] Patch wrong warping
[ ] Activate ocarina menu on button press rather than hover
[ ] Custom tunic colours

Future Plans:
[ ] Rename warp codes properly for OW and UWs (and adjust OW2 descriptions)
[ ] Renumber the OW zones
[ ] Properly add ignored warps to randomizer and exclude them until sorted out

- Ideas for game modes:
	[ ] Make each intrument reveal one of the 8 egg directions (either replace instrument sprites or find way to tie it to the book)
	[ ] Make each telephone booth reveal one of the egg directions (intruments may not be required to beat the game)
	[ ] Make only a select few (i.e. 3) instruments required to open the egg, and place WHICH instruments in the book
	[ ] Place the instruments directly in the phone booths

[ ] Find way to disable dialog without breaking functionality
	- other option is to just reduce dialog text
[ ] Add seed hash to title screen (as with ALttP)
[ ] Create output hash based on the randomized elements (use to check for collisions in bulk tests)
[ ] Remove side of MeowMeow's house on doghouse screen
[ ] Switch to U1.0 instead of J1.0
[ ] Add 'Dungeon Guantlet' mode
[ ] Add option to shuffle dungeon/cave stairs
[ ] Find way to shuffle portals
	
[ ] Add item randomization
	- Begin with only shuffling items within dungeons

[ ] (Re-)implement softlock-free logic?
	[ ] Make sword pickup mandatory before exploring
	[ ] Add map edits for Zone 10
	[ ] Force deadends behind bombable caves instead of opening them
	[ ] Fix remaining one-ways:
		[ ] make flame skip cave require L2 shield both ways, or have flame skip only take 1 hit
		[ ] D8 entrance on OW (one-way w/o bombs)
		[ ] Richard's villa and cave
		[ ] stone-covered entrances (force deadends)
		[ ] prevent flock clipping dream shrine and woods cave??
		[ ] Mamu's cave (force deadend)
	
Ignored warps:
- Village well
- Fisherman's bridge (need to figure out effect of difference in format)
- Martha's Bay SS
- Manbo's cave
- Flooded cave
- (Pit to flooded cave)

Known Issues:
- "Glitchless" logic still accounts for bombs at walrus
- "Glitchless" logic likely has gaps in D8
- D7 entrance and mermaid cave connections aren't properly accounted for (due to outward softlocks)
- Shuffling the mermaid cave can result in a glitched ML
- Singpost maze stops working after obtaining song #3
- Pathfinder only recognizes D6 and D8 from the front entrances (is this a problem?)
- It may be possible to have mushroom and require the powder without access to the witch
- It's possible to exit into the undrained waterfall without the flippers (you can't house warp from this)
- It may be required to enter D0 entrance, but be unable to get rid of bow wow (or another follower)
- D7 instrument clears the rooster, which may be required (glitchless)
- Bowwow prevents trading for the monkey bridge (not currently in logic)
- Rapids ride is currently unaccounted for as a connection
- Richard won't move before bowwow has been rescued
		
Notes:
- "Glitchless" logic still assumes knowledge of:
	- walrus skip
	- bombable walls in D8 (and bomb-arrows)
