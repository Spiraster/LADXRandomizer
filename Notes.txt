Disabled warps:
- Village well
- Fisherman's bridge (need to figure out effect of difference in format)
- Martha's Bay SS
- Manbo's cave
- Flooded cave
- (Pit to flooded cave)

Warps with 2 addresses:
- Boomerang moblin's cave (needs to be merged)
- OW-0E entrance to D7 (need to add 0x247E6)
	- Check if any other locked dungeons have two warp addresses

Known Limitations:
- ExtendedZoneAccess() only goes 1 zone deep
- "Locked" warps can only connect to direct dead ends
- There's nothing stopping softlocks without the sword

Potential Issues:
- Hookshot gap cave being a 1-way without the feather
- Getting stuck in Zone 2 without the feather
- There may be issues with D3
- "OW1-13" may require special conditions (entrance to flame cave)
- Can D2 still spawn behind D6 stairs?

[x] Implement options support
[x] Add option to include Marin's house
[x] Add option to include the egg
[x] Add option to make sure no warps match the default
[x] Improve options implementation
[x] Consolidate IO methods
[x] Have filename include version
[x] Have the log show enabled/disabled options
[x] Write version and seed to ROM header
[x] Update options list to use custom class instead of Dictionary (for non-bool options)
[x] Add support in OptionsDialog and RandomizerIO for non-bool options
[x] Add dropdown menu to select base ROM version and add checksum values for these
[ ] Add option to shuffle dungeon/cave stairs
[ ] Add option to not pair warps
[ ] Add option to automatically save log
[ ] Write enabled options to ROM (0xFF000)
[ ] Block pit to flooded cave (or plan around it)
[ ] Use radio buttons to choose between presets or access to all options
[ ] Add option to avoid jesus jumps (prefer flippers over feather)
[ ] Add option to enable portals
[ ] Randomize intrument warps with entrance warps (separate option or not?)
[ ] Implement a settings bitmask
[ ] Add option to create dungeon gauntlet ROM
[ ] Add option to make ROMs always beatable
	[x] Gather all info for warps
	[ ] Update the list of warps in WarpData
	[x] Prevent physical dead ends from directly pairing, or along a physically constrained path
	[x] Fixed Pathfind so that it actually followed through warps instead of getting stuck in the initial area
	[x] Fixed Pathfind so that it (hopefully) won't get stuck in a loop if warps happen to loop
	[ ] Implement methods to check specific criteria AFTER warps have been shuffled
		[ ] If both Kanalet warps are dead-ends, then neither can be connected to 1st-floor Kanalet (wouldn't be able to open drawbridge)
		[x] Prevent dungeons from being constrained by their own dungeon item (use pathfinding)
		[ ] Somehow check zones in relation to dungeons (eg. D1 and D3 could both be confined to animal village)
	[x] Solve the issue with "locked" warps
	[ ] Might want to make adjustments due to directionality of certain connections (i.e. richards villa, bombable cave walls, D8)
	[ ] Prevent getting boxed in by bombable walls 
		
Notes:
	- "Dead-ends" are only physical dead-ends
	- Connections listed for all warps within a physical boundary
		- Item constraints are set per connection (not per area)
		- The direction for constraints are: FROM the connection TO the warp
	- ZoneConnections (in warps) are listed FROM the zone TO the warp (same convention as normal connections)
	- Zone objects will keep track exits that can access them (i.e. TO the zone FROM the warp)
	- One-way tunnels (i.e. D4 cave and raft cave) are treated as dead-ends for both warps

Zones:
	- Zone 1: Mabe Village & Mysterious Woods (incl. swamp telephone booth)
	- Zone 2: South of D8
		- Constrained by feather, and accessible from the mountain
		- All 3 can be dead-ends

	- Zone 6: Tal tal heights (physically isolated; split by water)
		- Act as a zone depending on jesus jump option
		- Can't be all dead-ends (unlike other zones) since you can only reach it via warps
		- Zone a: West of stairs
		- Zone b: North of stairs
		- Zone c: East of stairs
	- Zone ?: Animal Village, east of the bay, and Yarna Desert

[ ] Add chest randomization

[ ] Add option to disable dialog
