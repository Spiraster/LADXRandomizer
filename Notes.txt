Disabled warps:
- Village well
- Fisherman's bridge (need to figure out effect of difference in format)
- Martha's Bay SS
- Manbo's cave
- Flooded cave
- (Pit to flooded cave)

Warps with 2 addresses:
- Boomerang moblin's cave (needs to be merged)
- OW-0E entrance to D7 (need to add 0x247E6)
	- Check if any other locked dungeons have two warp addresses

Known Limitations:
- ExtendedZoneAccess() only goes 1 zone deep
- "Locked" warps are only allowed to connect to direct dead ends
- There's nothing stopping softlocks without the sword

Potential Issues:
- Hookshot gap cave being a 1-way without the feather
- Getting stuck in Zone 2 without the feather
- "OW1-13" may require special conditions (entrance to flame cave)
- Can D2 still spawn behind D6 stairs?
- It may be possible to get stuck behind bombable walls

[ ] Add option to shuffle dungeon/cave stairs
[ ] Add option to not pair warps
[ ] Add option to automatically save log
[ ] Write enabled options to ROM (0xFF000)
[ ] Block pit to flooded cave (or plan around it)
[ ] Use radio buttons to choose between presets or access to all options
[ ] Add option to avoid jesus jumps (prefer flippers over feather)
[ ] Add option to enable portals
[ ] Randomize intrument warps with entrance warps (separate option or not?)
[ ] Implement a settings bitmask
[ ] Add option to create dungeon gauntlet ROM
[ ] Add option to make ROMs always beatable
	[x] Gather all info for warps
	[ ] Update the list of warps in WarpData
	- Methods left to implement
		[ ] CheckZone8 (Kanalet)
		[ ] Add considerations for the waterfall to CheckD4
		[ ] Ensure that Zones 6 & 7 aren't isolated, or that dungeons are confined there
		[x] Allow D6 to spawn behind locked warps (given certain conditions)
		[ ] Make sure that the various 'checking' methods don't undo each other when creating new pairs
	[ ] Probably combine isAccessible and ExtendedZoneAccess methods
	[ ] Might want to make adjustments due to directionality of certain connections (i.e. richards villa, bombable cave walls, D8)
	
[ ] Add chest randomization

[ ] Add option to disable dialog
			
Notes:
	- "Dead-ends" are only physical dead-ends
	- Connections listed for all warps within a physical boundary
		- Item constraints are set per connection (not per area)
		- The direction for constraints are: FROM the connection TO the warp
	- ZoneConnections (in warps) are listed FROM the zone TO the warp (same convention as normal connections)
	- Zone objects will keep track exits that can access them (i.e. TO the zone FROM the warp)
	- One-way tunnels (i.e. D4 cave and raft cave) are treated as dead-ends for both warps
