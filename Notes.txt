Disabled warps:
- Village well
- Fisherman's bridge (need to figure out effect of difference in format)
- Martha's Bay SS
- Manbo's cave
- Flooded cave
- (Pit to flooded cave)

Known Limitations:
- ExtendedZoneAccess() only goes 1 zone deep
- 'Locked' warps are only allowed to connect to direct dead ends
- There's nothing stopping softlocks without the sword
- D6 and D8 are probably less likely to spawn behind a 'locked' warp than they could be
- Nothing prevents D6 or D7 keys from getting placed behind their respectice doors (although this isn't really an issue)

Potential Issues:
- 1-ways can lead to softlock situations
- Hookshot gap cave is a 1-way without the feather
- Richard's Villa is a 1-way without the slime key (or leaves)
- "OW1-13" may require special conditions (entrance to flame cave)
- Can D2 still spawn behind D6 stairs?
- It may be possible to get stuck behind bombable walls

[ ] Add 'Hard' preset (checked for solvability like 'Standard' but warps are unpaired)
[ ] Add 'Dungeon Guantlet' preset once details are worked out
[ ] Add option to shuffle dungeon/cave stairs
[ ] Add option to enable portals
[ ] Write enabled options to ROM (0xFF000)
[ ] Fix ValidPairing and CheckLocked to not make assumptions about the passed warps
[x] Randomize intrument warps with entrance warps (add as Address2)
[ ] Make logic adjustments
	[ ] S+Q takes you to dungeon entrance (fix D6 and D8)
	[ ] D4 cave entrance was not connected to a dead end
	[ ] Treat one-ways as their own thing (otherwise we get issues with locked warps)
	[ ] Account for warp under stone in Left TalTal (make Zone 2 always accessible?)
	[ ] Add considerations for the ghost (don't spawn "house by the bay" behind D5 or southern face shrine)
[ ] Update checks to accomodate unpaired warps
	[x] Replace GetPair with GetDestinationWarp & GetOriginWarp
	[ ] Update ValidPairing for the case of unpaired ROMs (a dead end could connect to another dead end provided the first is accessible and the second doesn't exit to a dead end)
	[ ] Update CheckLocked
	[ ] Update CreateNewPair
	
[ ] Add chest randomization

[ ] Add option to disable dialog
			
Notes:
	- "Dead-ends" are only physical dead-ends
	- Connections listed for all warps within a physical boundary
		- Item constraints are set per connection (not per area)
		- The direction for constraints are: FROM the connection TO the warp
	- ZoneConnections (in warps) are listed FROM the zone TO the warp (same convention as normal connections)
	- Zone objects will keep track exits that can access them (i.e. TO the zone FROM the warp)
	- One-way tunnels (i.e. D4 cave and raft cave) are treated as dead-ends for both warps
